There are 2 different scenes in the project. LevelEditor scene helps you create new levels. After creating and saving the levels, you don't need to do anything else to use them in the game.

In LevelEditor Scene you can do the following with on scene buttons and interfaces:
-Add/Delete different level objects.
-Change Road Color
-Save/Load/Delete Level.
-Change Level End Success condition.
-Test the level you created.

Game scene allows you to play the game with the levels you have created. If your level count exceeds the level amount you have created, it continues randomly between levels.
